The purpose of this page is to know how to set up a static website by means of using github web-hosing with Linux OS. The basic concept of this website shows what we have to achieve for graduating the university's course because understanding the precedure is quite complicated. Visitors may see some menus on the header layout. We hope you understand easily what kind of things should be necessary and important. If possible, we will continuously update the contents and implement something more dynamic.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
